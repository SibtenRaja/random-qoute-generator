      "Success means doing the best with what we have. Success is the doing, not the getting; in the trying, not the triumph. Success is a personal standard, reaching for the highest that is in us, becoming all that we can be.",
      "I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble.",
